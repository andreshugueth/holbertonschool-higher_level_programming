## Requirements

### Python Scripts

* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.\*)

### Python Unit Tests

* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test\_models/test\_base.py
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
* You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test\_models/test\_base.py
