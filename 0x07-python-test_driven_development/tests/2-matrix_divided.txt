 How to Use doctest_in_help.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``matrix_divided``.

Numbers
=======

``matrix_divided`` returns a matrix divided by each div number.

::

	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
	>>> matrix = [[2, 4, 6, 8, 10], [3, 6, 9, 12, 15], [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	[[0.67, 1.33, 2.0, 2.67, 3.33], [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], [1.33, 2.67, 4.0, 5.33, 6.67]]

trying another matrix

::

	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

trying a str in a matrix

::

	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], ['sr', 5, 'hola']]

trying not the same number of row

	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	Traceback (most recent call last):

trying a str and different number of row
