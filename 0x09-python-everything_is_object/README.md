# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## Background Context

This project is a little bit different than the usual projects. The first part is only questions about Python’s specificity like “What would be the result of…”. You should read all documentation first (as usual :)), then take the time to think and brainstorm with your peers about what you think and why. Try to do this without coding anything for a few hours.

Trying examples in the Python interpreter will give you most of the answers without having to think about it. Don’t go this route. First read, then think, then brainstorm together. Only then you can test in the interpreter.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.\*)
* All your files must be executable

### .txt Answer Files

* Only one line
* No Shebang
* All your files should end with a new line
